# Linear Regression Model From scracth 
This project is based on the implementation of Linear Regression Model from scratch. I have just used numpy library to work with matrixes.
For R2 score I imported it from scikit-learn library. I have tested this model on a Gass Mileage Prediction dataset and it gave 81.6% testing accuracy. 
You can use any dataset you want, if you are facing issues with less accuracy or the mean squared error  is not decreasing then you just need to 
update the learning rate until it will work best for you. In my case I used the ```learning rate = 0.0000001 ```. 


## How to use this model
If you want to use this model you just need to import ```LinearRegressionModel()``` class from ```LinearRegressionModel.py``` file.

### Output
After running this project you will get the output in terminal with all information.
